0.1.14 (2025-06-11)
-------------------

* Breaking changes

    * Remove MSFList:

        * It was created for integer choices and it is a misconception (`01dcad230dc368b88a39bfc36f90ddd145f381a2 <https://github.com/goinnn/django-multiselectfield/commit/01dcad230dc368b88a39bfc36f90ddd145f381a2>`_)

    * In to_python value is or a list or a string. (`c4579138dda2833cbce26afbf57da5353aa45690 <https://github.com/goinnn/django-multiselectfield/commit/c4579138dda2833cbce26afbf57da5353aa45690>`_)

        * Remove set case and dict case
        * Please, If this breaks something, you can create a test to understand the use case

    * Removing integer choices:

        * It was an error. MultiSelectField inheritances of CharField, not IntegerField.
        * It is impossible knows if original choice is (1, 'Item title 2.1') or ('1', 'Item title 2.1')
